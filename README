I2MEX: ideal 2-d Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibrium on Xplasma
===========================================================

I2MEX, by providing a standard equilibrium representation, allows stability
codes to obtain metric information from a variety of equilibrium sources.
These include GEQDSK (EFIT format), INP1/inp1.cdf (CHEASE), eqdsk.cdf (JSOLVER)
as well as TRANSP run data stored on local file system or in the MDSPlus tree.

I2MEX is based on a minimal set of data: the scalar pressure, safety factor, 
covariant toroidal B field plus the (X, Z) coordinates which are loaded-in at 
initialization. All metric quantities are computed on the fly on arbitrary, 
user-specified grids (poloidal angle, poloidal flux/2*pi), using bi-cubic splines.

1) Installation
---------------

See INSTALL file. 

Normally all you have to do is 

gmake all

This will by default install a library under ../<platform>/lib and a test executable
 ../<platform>/test/i2mex

Please check that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable points to the location of your
MDSPlus library. Eg, 

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/mdsplus/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} 

under csh, or

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mdsplus/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

under bash, sh, and ksh.


2) Test run
-----------

The various supported equilibrium input formats can be checked by running 
 ../<platform>/test/i2mex. You will need to have the following files accessible:
INP1, inp1.cdf, g*. To test the MDSPlus capability you will also need permission
to enable MDSPlus access (contact your local administrator). 

The test program i2mex will dump 3 files: drive.mtv, gserror.dx and mapdsk.cdf
which can be used to visualize the results. 

If you have plotmtv installed type 

plotmtv drive.mtv

To see the error of the Grad-Shafranov solution using openDX type

export DXDATA=`pwd` (or equivalent under csh)
dx &
(then select run "Run visual program")
(select "gserror.net")


The content of mapdsk.cdf can be viewed through matlab, type:

matlab
mapdsk
(you will need the netCDF toolbox to be installed, modify mapdsk.m to change 
this location if necessary).


3) mex2eqs
----------
   retrieve and map equilibrium data for postprocessing by EQS,
   the front end to ORBIT
   Note: you can not use the included inputfiles for the i2mex test program. 
 
4) Documention
--------------

All methods are documented in index.htm

Good luck!
